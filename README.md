# IStream

This Python project simulates a livestream environment where the comments are generated by language models (LLMs) based on the analysis of a vision model. The vision model processes the video feed, and the LLMs generate relevant comments in real-time, creating a dynamic and engaging experience for the viewers.
Features

- *Vision Model Integration:* The project integrates with a vision model (LLaVA) to analyze the video feed and extract relevant information.
- *Language Model Integration:* The project utilizes language models (Phi-3) to generate realistic and contextual comments based on the vision model's analysis.
- *Real-time Comment Generation:* Comments are generated in real-time, simulating a live chat experience.
<!--- *Configurable Comment Generation:* You can customize the comment generation rate, language model parameters, and other settings to suit your needs.-->
